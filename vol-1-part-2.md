SOO BAK-GI IN THE KORYO DYNASTY

In another interesting study, Dr. An Ja San has stated in his book of ancient Korea, "Chosun Moosa Yongoung Jun", the biography of Korean warriors, that the Yoo Sul school (which could now be considered Jujitsu) was known under the name of Soo Bak-Gi or Taek Kyon.

Annually during the month of May, the King, in person, held a match of this form of unarmed combat at the Kak Chon pavillion on Ma Am mountain. The winner of this contest was awarded a prestigious government post. The King also made the contest compulsory for all soldiers. Three of the winners of this annual contest-Lee Yi Min, JangJoong Boo and Sa Kang Sung eventually became leading generals during the Koryo Dynasty. It appears that the King held more than a passing interest in the art.

These were twenty-five fundamental movements or postures used by practitioners. Their postures incorporated hand, leg, jumping, falling, rolling and pulling techniques. Below are listed the postures:

Certainly the Silla and Koryo Dynasties marked a flowering of the martial arts in Korea. Soon after, however, these dynasties acquired anti-military positions. Though this began a period of civil enlightenment, anything dealing with the military was debased. By the end of the Yi Dynasty the martial arts appeared to have ceased existing.

The final blow came with the Japanese occupation (1909-1 945) when it was forbidden to practice any of the martial arts. Taek Kyon was secretly practiced by some dedicated stalwarts and passed on to a handful of students.

Proponents of the art, such as Song Duk Ki, Han II Dong and a few others, managed to keep the art alive.

After the liberation of Korea in 1945, the new Republic of Korea Armed forces was organised on January 15. 1946. A young second Lieutenant, Choi Hong Hi, recently released from a Japanese prison camp, began teaching his martial art to some of his soldiers. The rest, of course, is history, resulting in what is today known throughout the world as Taekwon-Do.

In 1955, the name Taekwon-Do was chosen as the new name of the national martial art by a board of instructors, historians and other prominent persons. The name submitted by General Choi was unanimously selected for its apt description of the art; Tae (foot), Kwon (fist). Do (art). Not only did this new name bear a close similarity to the ancient name of Taek Kyon, but the name gave a new sense of nationalism to the art, where as the prevalent names of Dang Soo and Kong Soo connoted Chinese or Japanese martial arts.

The years of research and development by General Choi resulted in the Chang Hun style (pen name of the author) of Taekwon-Do. Though this style is primarily based on Taek Kyon, Soo Bak-Gi and Karate techniques, a myriad of techniques have been added, especially in the variety of hand techniques and perfection of foot techniques.

The Chan Hun style is based on twenty four patterns, each perfected and polished by General Choi Hong Hi and his colleagues, from the white belt pattern Chon-Ji 10 the highest, Tong II.

After 1,300 years, Korean martial art has reached full maturity and has spread from a small band of aristocratic warriors to practitioners in more than sixty countries with millions of students. The combination of the old classical techniques and new modifications have resulted in a form of self-defence and mental conditioning unrivaled in the modern world.

The above history was released in the weekly magazine of Chosun daily newspaper by Dr. Lee Sun Kun, President of Kyung Puk University in 1969 and one of Korea's most noted historians.

On the other hand, Funakosi Kijin (commonly known as the father of Japanese Karate) wrote a book in 1958. claiming that Karate is the traditional martial art of Okinawa. He stated that it had been developed since the 9th century A.D. under the name of "Te" (hand). When the Okinawan techniques, modified by collaboration with Chinese Kempo (fist method), the art became known as "Dote" (Chinese hand). The first exhibition of this martial art took place in 1917 and in subsequent years it rapidly gained popularity on the Japanese mainland. In the early 1930s, the word "Do" (China) was replaced by the word "Ku" (empty) to distinguish Japanese Karate from Chinese Kempo. In Sino-Japanese writing, "Do" or ''Kara" means China.

In a book of Karate written by Nagadoni, the author states that according to legend and myth, there was a type of open hand fighting that resembled present day Sumo(Japanese wrestling) and Judo in Japan about 2,000 years ago.

Some theories are more highly glossed than others, but the continuing arguments about the origins of open hand and foot fighting are unlikely to be resolved.

A dispute over which country could claim the first use of fire would hardly be more pointless. The Chinese theory is the most readily accepted because China was the cradle of Oriental culture; but this does not necessarily mean that the martial arts had their beginning there as well. Open hand and foot fighting probably did not originate in any one country.

It is, more than likely, a natural development that occurred in different places, as the need arose for a systematic method of defence. Thus the home of each martial art will definitely depend on the nationality of its founder, but not the historical length of a country.



## HISTORY OF TAEKWON-DO (Taekwon-Do Yoksa)

Although the origins of the martial arts are shrouded in mystery, we consider it an undeniable fact that from time immemorial there have been physical actions involving the use or the hands and feet for purpose of self-protection.

If we were to define these physical actions as "Taekwon-Do." any country might claim credit for inventing Taekwon-Do. There is, however, scant resemblance between Taekwon-Do, as it is practiced today, and the crude forms of unarmed combat developed in the past.

Modern Taekwon-Do differs greatly from other martial arts. In fact, no other martial art is so advanced with regard to the sophistication and effectiveness of its technique or the over-all physical fitness it imparts to its practitioners.

Since the theories, terminology, techniques, systems, methods, rules, practice suit, and spiritual foundation were scientifically developed, systematized, and named by the author, it is an error to think of any physical actions employing the hand and feet for self-defence as Taekwon-Do. Nor is any other martial arts system entitled to call itself Taekwon-Do. Only those who practice the techniques based on the author's theories, principles and philosophy are considered to be students of genuine Taekwon-Do.

When and where did Taekwon-Do begin?

A combination of circumstances made it possible for me to originate and develop Taekwon-Do. In addition to my prior knowledge of Taek Kyon, I had an opportunity to learn Karate in Japan during the unhappy thirty-six years when my native land was occupied by the Japanese. Soon after Korea was liberated in 1945, I was placed in a privileged position as a founding member of the newly formed South Korean Armed Forces.

The former provided me with a definite sense of creation, and the latter gave me the power to disseminate Taekwon-Do throughout the entire armed forces, despite furious opposition.

The emergence of Taekwon-Do as an international martial art in a relatively short period of time was due to a variety of factors. The evils of contemporary society (moral corruption, materialism, selfishness, etc.) had created a spiritual vacuum. Taekwon-Do was able to compensate for the prevailing sense of emptiness, distrust, decadence and lack of confidence.

In addition, these were violent times, when people felt the need for a means of protecting themselves, and the superiority of Taekwon-Do technique came to be widely recognized. My social statue, the advantage of being Taekwon-Do's founder and my God-given health also contributed to the rapid growth of Taekwon-Do all over the world.

My involvement with the martial arts did much to supplement the health that God gave me. I had been born frail and weak and was encouraged to learn Taek Kyon at the age of fifteen by my teacher of calligraphy. In 1938, a few days before I was due to leave Korea to study in Japan. I was involved in an unexpected incident that would have made it difficult to return home without risk of reprisals.

I resolved to become a black belt holder in Karate while I was in Japan.

The skills I required were, I felt, sufficient protection against those who might seek to do me harm. Not only was I able to return to Korea, but I subsequently initiated the national liberation movement known as the Pyongyang Student Soldiers Incident. Like so many patriots in the long course of human history, my actions aroused the wrath of those in positions of power. I was imprisoned for a time in a Japanese army jail. In January of 1946, I was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the fledgling Republic of Korea army and posted to the 4th infantry regiment in Kwangju, Cholla Namdo Province as a company commander.

I began to teach Karate to my soldiers as a means of physical and mental training. It was then that I realized that we needed to develop our own national martial art, superior in both spirit and technique to Japanese Karate. I strongly believed that teaching it throughout the country would enable me to fulfil the pledge I had made to three of my comrades, who had shared my imprisonment by the Japanese. "The reason that our people suffer in this way at the hands of the Japanese," I had said, "is that our ancestors failed to rule wisely".

" They exploited the people and, in the end, lost the country to foreign domination. If we ever regain our freedom and independence, let us not become the rulers of the people. Instead, let us dedicate ourselves to advising those who rule."

It was with this ambition in mind that I began to develop new techniques, systematically, from March of that same year. By the end of 1954 I had nearly completed the foundation of a new martial art for Korea, and on April 11, 1955, it was given the name "Taekwon-Do".

On the spiritual level, Taekwon-Do is derived from the traditional, ethical and moral principles of the orient and, of course, from my personal philosophy.

Even though I am only five feet tall, I pride myself on having lived in strict accordance with my moral convictions. I have tried to fight on the side of justice without fear of any kind. I believe that this was possible for me only because of the formidable power and indomitable spirit instilled by Taekwon-Do.

The physical techniques of Taekwon-Do are based on the principles of modern science, in particular, Newtonian physics which teaches us how to generate maximum power. Military tactics of attack and defense have also been incorporated.

I wish to make it clear that although Karate and Taek Kyon were used as references in the course of my study, the fundamental theories and principles of Taekwon-Do are totally different from those of any other martial art in the world.

In March of 1959, I led the military Taekwon-Do demonstration team on a tour abroad. We visited South Vietnam and Taiwan. It was the first such visit in the history of Korea. On this occasion, I renewed my resolution to leave my personal legacy to the world, in the form of Taekwon-Do, and I formulated the following basic ideals for the Taekwon-Do practitioners:

1. By developing an upright mind and a strong body, we will acquire the self-confidence to stand on the side of justice at all times.
2. We shall unite with all men in a common brother-hood, without regard to religion, race, national or ideological boundaries.
3. We shall dedicate ourselves 10 building a peaceful human society in which justice, morality, trust and humanism prevail.

I also resolved to dedicate myself 10 the world-wide propagation of Taekwon-Do, in the sincere hope that it would provide the means by which the unification of the divided halves of my fatherland would become possible.

My study of Taekwon-Do proceeded in two parts, spiritual discipline and technical perfection. Because the human spirit belongs to the realm of metaphysics, what I mean by spiritual discipline is not easy to describe. One cannot touch, see or hear the spirit of man.

It is wider and deeper than anything we can perceive.

In this respect, I, myself, am only another student participating in a continuing and neverending learning process.

I have come to define the spiritual dimensions of Taekwon-Do as fusing oneself with the ideals of Taekwon-Do and attaining and understanding the full meaning of each of the Taekwon-Do patterns. If we consider ourselves as one with Taekwon-Do, we will respect it as we respect our own bodies and Taekwon-Do will never be used in a dishonorable way.
