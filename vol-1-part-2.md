SOO BAK-GI IN THE KORYO DYNASTY

In another interesting study, Dr. An Ja San has stated in his book of ancient Korea, "Chosun Moosa Yongoung Jun", the biography of Korean warriors, that the Yoo Sul school (which could now be considered Jujitsu) was known under the name of Soo Bak-Gi or Taek Kyon.

Annually during the month of May, the King, in person, held a match of this form of unarmed combat at the Kak Chon pavillion on Ma Am mountain. The winner of this contest was awarded a prestigious government post. The King also made the contest compulsory for all soldiers. Three of the winners of this annual contest-Lee Yi Min, JangJoong Boo and Sa Kang Sung eventually became leading generals during the Koryo Dynasty. It appears that the King held more than a passing interest in the art.

These were twenty-five fundamental movements or postures used by practitioners. Their postures incorporated hand, leg, jumping, falling, rolling and pulling techniques. Below are listed the postures:

Certainly the Silla and Koryo Dynasties marked a flowering of the martial arts in Korea. Soon after, however, these dynasties acquired anti-military positions. Though this began a period of civil enlightenment, anything dealing with the military was debased. By the end of the Yi Dynasty the martial arts appeared to have ceased existing.

The final blow came with the Japanese occupation (1909-1 945) when it was forbidden to practice any of the martial arts. Taek Kyon was secretly practiced by some dedicated stalwarts and passed on to a handful of students.

Proponents of the art, such as Song Duk Ki, Han II Dong and a few others, managed to keep the art alive.

After the liberation of Korea in 1945, the new Republic of Korea Armed forces was organised on January 15. 1946. A young second Lieutenant, Choi Hong Hi, recently released from a Japanese prison camp, began teaching his martial art to some of his soldiers. The rest, of course, is history, resulting in what is today known throughout the world as Taekwon-Do.

In 1955, the name Taekwon-Do was chosen as the new name of the national martial art by a board of instructors, historians and other prominent persons. The name submitted by General Choi was unanimously selected for its apt description of the art; Tae (foot), Kwon (fist). Do (art). Not only did this new name bear a close similarity to the ancient name of Taek Kyon, but the name gave a new sense of nationalism to the art, where as the prevalent names of Dang Soo and Kong Soo connoted Chinese or Japanese martial arts.

The years of research and development by General Choi resulted in the Chang Hun style (pen name of the author) of Taekwon-Do. Though this style is primarily based on Taek Kyon, Soo Bak-Gi and Karate techniques, a myriad of techniques have been added, especially in the variety of hand techniques and perfection of foot techniques.

The Chan Hun style is based on twenty four patterns, each perfected and polished by General Choi Hong Hi and his colleagues, from the white belt pattern Chon-Ji 10 the highest, Tong II.

After 1,300 years, Korean martial art has reached full maturity and has spread from a small band of aristocratic warriors to practitioners in more than sixty countries with millions of students. The combination of the old classical techniques and new modifications have resulted in a form of self-defence and mental conditioning unrivaled in the modern world.

The above history was released in the weekly magazine of Chosun daily newspaper by Dr. Lee Sun Kun, President of Kyung Puk University in 1969 and one of Korea's most noted historians.

On the other hand, Funakosi Kijin (commonly known as the father of Japanese Karate) wrote a book in 1958. claiming that Karate is the traditional martial art of Okinawa. He stated that it had been developed since the 9th century A.D. under the name of "Te" (hand). When the Okinawan techniques, modified by collaboration with Chinese Kempo (fist method), the art became known as "Dote" (Chinese hand). The first exhibition of this martial art took place in 1917 and in subsequent years it rapidly gained popularity on the Japanese mainland. In the early 1930s, the word "Do" (China) was replaced by the word "Ku" (empty) to distinguish Japanese Karate from Chinese Kempo. In Sino-Japanese writing, "Do" or ''Kara" means China.

In a book of Karate written by Nagadoni, the author states that according to legend and myth, there was a type of open hand fighting that resembled present day Sumo(Japanese wrestling) and Judo in Japan about 2,000 years ago.

Some theories are more highly glossed than others, but the continuing arguments about the origins of open hand and foot fighting are unlikely to be resolved.

A dispute over which country could claim the first use of fire would hardly be more pointless. The Chinese theory is the most readily accepted because China was the cradle of Oriental culture; but this does not necessarily mean that the martial arts had their beginning there as well. Open hand and foot fighting probably did not originate in any one country.

It is, more than likely, a natural development that occurred in different places, as the need arose for a systematic method of defence. Thus the home of each martial art will definitely depend on the nationality of its founder, but not the historical length of a country.



## HISTORY OF TAEKWON-DO (Taekwon-Do Yoksa)

Although the origins of the martial arts are shrouded in mystery, we consider it an undeniable fact that from time immemorial there have been physical actions involving the use or the hands and feet for purpose of self-protection.

If we were to define these physical actions as "Taekwon-Do." any country might claim credit for inventing Taekwon-Do. There is, however, scant resemblance between Taekwon-Do, as it is practiced today, and the crude forms of unarmed combat developed in the past.

Modern Taekwon-Do differs greatly from other martial arts. In fact, no other martial art is so advanced with regard to the sophistication and effectiveness of its technique or the over-all physical fitness it imparts to its practitioners.

Since the theories, terminology, techniques, systems, methods, rules, practice suit, and spiritual foundation were scientifically developed, systematized, and named by the author, it is an error to think of any physical actions employing the hand and feet for self-defence as Taekwon-Do. Nor is any other martial arts system entitled to call itself Taekwon-Do. Only those who practice the techniques based on the author's theories, principles and philosophy are considered to be students of genuine Taekwon-Do.

When and where did Taekwon-Do begin?

A combination of circumstances made it possible for me to originate and develop Taekwon-Do. In addition to my prior knowledge of Taek Kyon, I had an opportunity to learn Karate in Japan during the unhappy thirty-six years when my native land was occupied by the Japanese. Soon after Korea was liberated in 1945, I was placed in a privileged position as a founding member of the newly formed South Korean Armed Forces.

The former provided me with a definite sense of creation, and the latter gave me the power to disseminate Taekwon-Do throughout the entire armed forces, despite furious opposition.

The emergence of Taekwon-Do as an international martial art in a relatively short period of time was due to a variety of factors. The evils of contemporary society (moral corruption, materialism, selfishness, etc.) had created a spiritual vacuum. Taekwon-Do was able to compensate for the prevailing sense of emptiness, distrust, decadence and lack of confidence.

In addition, these were violent times, when people felt the need for a means of protecting themselves, and the superiority of Taekwon-Do technique came to be widely recognized. My social statue, the advantage of being Taekwon-Do's founder and my God-given health also contributed to the rapid growth of Taekwon-Do all over the world.

My involvement with the martial arts did much to supplement the health that God gave me. I had been born frail and weak and was encouraged to learn Taek Kyon at the age of fifteen by my teacher of calligraphy. In 1938, a few days before I was due to leave Korea to study in Japan. I was involved in an unexpected incident that would have made it difficult to return home without risk of reprisals.

I resolved to become a black belt holder in Karate while I was in Japan.

The skills I required were, I felt, sufficient protection against those who might seek to do me harm. Not only was I able to return to Korea, but I subsequently initiated the national liberation movement known as the Pyongyang Student Soldiers Incident. Like so many patriots in the long course of human history, my actions aroused the wrath of those in positions of power. I was imprisoned for a time in a Japanese army jail. In January of 1946, I was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the fledgling Republic of Korea army and posted to the 4th infantry regiment in Kwangju, Cholla Namdo Province as a company commander.

I began to teach Karate to my soldiers as a means of physical and mental training. It was then that I realized that we needed to develop our own national martial art, superior in both spirit and technique to Japanese Karate. I strongly believed that teaching it throughout the country would enable me to fulfil the pledge I had made to three of my comrades, who had shared my imprisonment by the Japanese. "The reason that our people suffer in this way at the hands of the Japanese," I had said, "is that our ancestors failed to rule wisely".

" They exploited the people and, in the end, lost the country to foreign domination. If we ever regain our freedom and independence, let us not become the rulers of the people. Instead, let us dedicate ourselves to advising those who rule."

It was with this ambition in mind that I began to develop new techniques, systematically, from March of that same year. By the end of 1954 I had nearly completed the foundation of a new martial art for Korea, and on April 11, 1955, it was given the name "Taekwon-Do".

On the spiritual level, Taekwon-Do is derived from the traditional, ethical and moral principles of the orient and, of course, from my personal philosophy.

Even though I am only five feet tall, I pride myself on having lived in strict accordance with my moral convictions. I have tried to fight on the side of justice without fear of any kind. I believe that this was possible for me only because of the formidable power and indomitable spirit instilled by Taekwon-Do.

The physical techniques of Taekwon-Do are based on the principles of modern science, in particular, Newtonian physics which teaches us how to generate maximum power. Military tactics of attack and defense have also been incorporated.

I wish to make it clear that although Karate and Taek Kyon were used as references in the course of my study, the fundamental theories and principles of Taekwon-Do are totally different from those of any other martial art in the world.

In March of 1959, I led the military Taekwon-Do demonstration team on a tour abroad. We visited South Vietnam and Taiwan. It was the first such visit in the history of Korea. On this occasion, I renewed my resolution to leave my personal legacy to the world, in the form of Taekwon-Do, and I formulated the following basic ideals for the Taekwon-Do practitioners:

1. By developing an upright mind and a strong body, we will acquire the self-confidence to stand on the side of justice at all times.
2. We shall unite with all men in a common brother-hood, without regard to religion, race, national or ideological boundaries.
3. We shall dedicate ourselves 10 building a peaceful human society in which justice, morality, trust and humanism prevail.

I also resolved to dedicate myself 10 the world-wide propagation of Taekwon-Do, in the sincere hope that it would provide the means by which the unification of the divided halves of my fatherland would become possible.

My study of Taekwon-Do proceeded in two parts, spiritual discipline and technical perfection. Because the human spirit belongs to the realm of metaphysics, what I mean by spiritual discipline is not easy to describe. One cannot touch, see or hear the spirit of man.

It is wider and deeper than anything we can perceive.

In this respect, I, myself, am only another student participating in a continuing and neverending learning process.

I have come to define the spiritual dimensions of Taekwon-Do as fusing oneself with the ideals of Taekwon-Do and attaining and understanding the full meaning of each of the Taekwon-Do patterns. If we consider ourselves as one with Taekwon-Do, we will respect it as we respect our own bodies and Taekwon-Do will never be used in a dishonorable way.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Life and work become one.</p></figcaption></figure>

The names of the patterns are derived from the most illustrious people to have been produced by nearly five thousand years of Korean history. A proper understanding of the patterns leads, inevitably to the realization that TaekwonDo is a martial art to be used only for self-defense and only in the cause of ' . JUSl!Ce.

The history of Korea contains not a single sample of its military forces being employed for the invasion of its neighbors or for any other purpose except national defence.

In the technical area. I created a wide variety of techniques that can be used in almost any situation. They are based on the following principles;

1. All movement should be designed to produce maximum power in accordance with scientific formulas and the principle of kinetic energy.
2. The principles behind the techniques should be so clear that even those ignorant ofTaekwon-Do will be able to distinguish correct from incorrect movement.
3. The distance and angle or each movement should be exactly defined in order to achieve more efficient attack and defense.
4. The purpose and method of each movement should be clear and simple, in order to facilitate the teaching and learning process.
5. Rational teaching methods should be developed so that the benefits of Taekwon-Do can be enjoyed by everyone, young and old, men and women.
6. Correct breathing methods should be devised, enhancing the speed of each movement and reducing fatigue
7. Attack should be possible against any vital spot on the body and it should be possible to defend against all varieties of attack.
8. Each attacking tool should be clearly defined and soundly based on the structure of the human body.
9. Each movement should be easy to execute, enabling the student to enjoy Taekwon-Do as a sport and recreation.
10. Special consideration should be paid to promoting good health and preventing injuries.
11. Each movement should be harmonious and rhythmical so that TaekwonDo is aesthetically pleasing.

1 2. Each movement in a pattern must express the personality and spiritual character of the person it is named after.

Adherance to these basic principles is what makes Taekwon-Do a martial art, an aesthetic art, a science and sport.

## MORAL CULTURE (JungshinSooyang)

The broad connotations and various possible interpretations of the moral culture are often very difficult for the western mind to grasp because this is an aspect of Oriental Philosophy which pervades the lives of Oriental people. In a word, it is the endeavor and process of becoming an exemplary person such as Confucius (552-479 A.O.).

To become such a person, one has to first find himself and acquire a moral character which is respected by all. This can only be achieved through constant practice of mental discipline. Thus, if the times call for it, the mentally disciplined man can contribute to the building of an ideal society through wise counsel to the government and, even after death, through his everlasting examples.

Confucius said, "to promote the sense of morality one must treat others with faithfulness and sincerity based on righteousness. and to eliminate completely vicious thinking",

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Moral Culture</p></figcaption></figure>

Everyone of us, as a social being, desires to live in a free and peaceful society. At the same time. it is our obligation to build such society for the people.

I have quoted various words of wisdom of ancient saints and philosophers for creating an ideal society in the hope that students of Taekwon -Do use them as a guide to cultivating their moral culture.

An ideal society, according to LAO-TZU, is one in w hich the ruler is of such high moral character that he can rule naturally, not by interference or fear but by appealing to the good nature of his people, who by merely doing their duty can live freely in peace without fear and anxiety.

Next, a moral society is one in which the people admire and praise their ruler in gratitude for his love and the benign disposition he bears toward his people.

Thirdly there is a "legalistic society in w hich the ruler because he lacks the moral authority resorts to various laws to govern his people. who in turn obey because they fear the retribution that the violation of these laws will bring. Under these circumstances. the ruler loses close touch with his people.

Finally the worst kind of society is that in which the ruler, through deception and trickery, misuses his legal authority to further his personal ambitions and imposes his rule upon his people by force as he deems necessary. In such a society, the ruler is despised and hated by his people and eventually invites not only his own downfall but with him the downfall of the people and the country.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In Taekwon-Do a heavy emphasis is placed on moral culture. for it not only promotes a healthy body and keen mind but good sportsmanship and the perfection of moral behavior. As ancient Greeks first espoused in their sound mind, sound body, creative spirit concept, the more disciplined and cultivated the mind is. the more disciplined and cultivated w ill be the student's use of Taekwon-Do.

No doubt the following lessons may be somewhat hard to fully understand; however, it would behove the serious student of Taekwon-Do to read. digest. and attempt to grasp these very fundamental essences of moral culture.

A. Return to the basic nature-Mencius gave the following analogy when he reasoned that a man is basically good.

Even a ruthless robber, coming upon an innocent child about to fall into a w ell, will try to save the child, forgetting for the moment. his intention to rob the house. This good nature becomes obscured or completely lost by greed for money and power.

B. Be virtuous-It is difficult to define what virtue is. However. these are five human qualities which have been recognized as virtues since ancient times; humanity, righteousness. courtesy, wisdom, and trust. To be virtuous one must constantly cultivate and practice these virtues.

Confucius said:

"Virtue is like the north star. All the stars revolve around it in an orderly fashion:·

Therefore. people w ho surround the virtuous person. naturally will act for the betterment of society.

**1 - HUMANITY (IN)**

The abilty to feel sorrow for the misfortunes of fellow men and love them all equally as parents love their children equally.

Confucius defined humanity in the following ways:

A. To love people, especially one's parents.

B. Not asking others to do what you would rather not do.

C. To behave w ith the nature of propriety by controlling on oneself.

D. To have unbending desire to accomplish w hat is right regardless of how insignificant the result may initially seem w hen compared to the amount of effort put forth.

E. To value others· honour before your own.

F. To put others' freedom before your own.

To implement humanity he said one should:

1. Practice utmost prudence, modesty and discretion in everyday life.
2. Devote oneself to assigned work be it large or small.
3. Demonstrate sincerity vvith whole heartedness to others at all times.

Tae Kong Mang (12th century B.C.) said;

"The heaven provides four seasons while the earth has the power to produce all living things. This privilege is not reserved for any specific person but for all human beings ... Therefore, humanity lies in the idea of sharing the fruits of nature with all people."

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**2 - RIGHTEOUSNESS (UI)**

The ability to feel ashamed of unjust acts and to do one's duty to others. Mencius said; "for the ordinary person life and death are the most important in the life. However, for the virtuous person to live and die for righteousness is far more important than life and death themselves ...

Righteousness is well defined in the act of a certain army general depicted in the book of "War Manual" written about 2.400 years ago.

A General was taking a break from the gruelling war with his soldiers by a river bank when an aide brought him a small carafe of wine for his refreshment. He took the carafe and slowly emptied it into the flowing river in full view of the puzzled soldiers and invited them 10 share the wine with him by taking a sip of the w ater from the river.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

3. PROPRIETY (YE)

Unlike animals fighting over food, a courteous man would offer another man a piece of bread even though both were starving. out of respect and good manners.

Confucius said, "propriety must be prac11sed for the proper development of personality. and whoever lacks sincerity in his w ords, cannot be considered a gentleman ...

He also said:

Frankness without courtesy can be rather ruthless."

··Respectfulness w ithout courtesy can make the recipient rather uncomfortable."

"Courageousness without courtesy can be rather violent."

4. WISDOM (JI)

The ability to judge right from wrong, not especially in matters concerning the right and wrong of others but in matters concerning oneself.

A wise man (Yu Bee) once said to his sons. " no matter how small it is you should not do what you realize is wrong. On the other hand you must do what is right no matter how small it may seem."

5. TRUST (SHIN)

The ability to keep one's words and promises, not only to one's friends but to everyone in general. Without trust a person loses all principles and dignities and becomes a liar and a cheater.

II

How. then\_. can man discover his own human nature?

There are two ways by which a person can find himself; first. by preserving the goodness given to him by God or heaven at birth, and secondly by renouncing greed for material things.

**A. Man may occupy two positions in a life time**

Basically there are two kinds of position; one is the five virtues given by heaven, explained earlier. and the other given by man. such as a cabinet minister. bureau chief, and so on.

Unfortunately man often relies too much on worldly position which is transient at bes1, for what ,nan gives can also betaken away. On the other hand, what heaven endows us w ith is eternal. This is not to say that we reject all worldly things but rather that we keep both positions in proper balance so that the virtues of the former position provides guidance for the proper use of the latter.

In this manner a man will gain respect and set good examples for others 10 follow. Without proper guidance. a person can easily fall victim to the temptations of personal power and wealth, employing unethical means to further his ambitions. Ultimately such a person w ill become a tyrant, or a dictator and an enemy of the people.

According to Confucius, a generous and loving man cannot have enemies. Therefore, humanity, the first virtue, is like a strong secure fortress.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Generous person has no enemy</p></figcaption></figure>

**B - Greed is insatiable**

He who is content w ith what he has is the richest man in the world. On the other hand, if one has everything and still n1ore, he may yet be poor. A man who is blinded by greed 1s not only given to corruption. intrigue and exploitation of others. but worst of all, he casts himself in the position of "friend fighting against friend, father fighting against son," final ly becoming no better than an animal.

There is certain truth ,n the old saying that a truly good person cannot be rich. and rich person cannot be a truly good person.

According to an anc,ent adage, " constant material dissatisfaction is considered to be the root of all misfortunes." There is no better way to self satisfaction and human growth than the constant development of a generous nature.

C. Be humble

A weed holds up its head in arrogance while a mature grain bows its head in humility. Lao-Tzu taught that lofty virtue is like a deep valley into which all streams of water flow. A virtuous man w ill draw the respect of others toward him in the same fashion whi le one who is selfish and egoistic will loose the respect of his fellow man and become despised and isolated.

To be humble is not to engage in petty squabbles, but 10 be like themagnamous river in the low valley w hich irrigates the farm fields around it.

D. Self-criticisn1

No one is wise from the moment of birth. As human beings we have many faults and are prone to make mistakes. However. once having acquired knowledge we learn to correct these shortcomings.

It would not be impossible to eventually became perfect human beings. For this purpose, it is essential not be idyllic towards learning and continue to be willing to criticize oneself.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Lofty virtue is like a deep valley</p></figcaption></figure>

It is said that Confucius and his pupils practised self-criticism by repeating the following three times daily:

1. Have I neglected others' requests because of selfishness
2. Have I behaved with a sincere attitude towards friends
3. Have I inspired others w ith certainty, while being uncertain myself
4. Have I neglected to practise virtue
5. Have I errored in my s' tudies
6. Have I avoided acting w ith righteousness
7. Have I corrected myself immediately upon realising my faul t

E. Be soft

Because light is formless and soft, it can illuminate and give warmth to even hidden corners. As water can assume any shape or form, it can better serve the living things that need it to survive. Once w ater becomes a part of the Ocean, even the largest ship is like a mere leaf, and its awesome fury when aroused can conquer the tallest mountain.

If one claims to be strong, he will soon meet someone who is stronger. A tree, such as sapling, can withstand a strong w ind when it is soft and flexible but may be toppled or broken after it becomes old and brittle. The same principle also applies to human beings.

F. Respect of elders

As son respects parents, younger brother respects older brother, man must always respect his elders or seniors. This is the beauty of mankind, and one of the distinctions between,human and animal.

Mencius said there are three things of value in human society; position, honor and moral integrity. In government, position is considered important, in a community, honor, and for a leader or advisor, moral integrity. Indeed, there can be no children without parents, nor a young generation without the old generation. A society and a nation could not avoid chaos without its culture and social order being based on respect for the knowledge and the wisdom of its elders.

G. Respect the rights of others

To criticize someone who is better, to covet other's possessions and to steal the merits of others are the marks of an unscrupulous man. Mother nature does make claims to her domain, yet all creatures within it acknowledge her eternal accomplishments. To help others develop and succeed in life is a reward in itself and has a true value only if nothing is expected in return.

Throughout human history, people who in jealousy have stolen the recognition due to others and have stolen their possessions out o f avarice have always left dark imprints of shame and dishonor.

H. Be just

To be correct and forthright is to live one·s life correctly. Old sages used to say; " To common men, life is most valuable, and death, most fearful." However, a righteous man would value justice above life itself and would be w illing to die rather than submit to injustice. Such notable figures as Baek-ESook-Je of China. Sung-Sam-Moon of Korea and Yoshida-Shoing of Japan all chose death in defiance of injustice. leaving to their posterity lasting examples.

Baek-E-Sook-Je lived in Chou period about 2,000 B.C. When King Moo toppled the twenty seventh King, who was a very notorious tyrant. he refused to serve the new King, who usurped the throne by force and not by legitimate process; he eventually starved to death in a self-imposed exile in the Sooyang mountains.

Sung-Sam -Moon w as an important minister of the King Se Jong, inventer of Han -Gui (Korean alphabet) in the 14th century. Arter the king died and the young Dan Jong became king his uncle Se-Jo conspired against the boy king and took over the throne. Minister Sung was later executed because of his persistent protest over the unlawful act of King Se-Jo. Yoshida-Shoing, one of the loyalists was also executed in protest when the Doku-Kawa military government. at the time, tried to abolish the Mei-Ji monarchy.

I. Be frugal

Since ancient times, excessive luxury and pleasure caused the downfall of many kings and nations without exception and history is full of such examples. Persons in leadership in particular must learn to be frugal and live moderately. As the old adage goes " if the w ater is muddy upstream so it will be downstream."

An extravagant leader will affect his subordinates in this same way and will bring more hardship to his subjects through increased taxation and bribery. During the Lee Dynasty of Korea. the king's roving inspector. Lee-MongYong, whi le traveling the countryside incognito, was invited to one of the lavish dinner parties of a notorious governor. In the middle of the feast, he recited his famous poem:

The sweet wine you drink from the glittering cups

Flows from the tears of people who toil

The tender meat which fills the dishes of jades is torn from their aching flesh&#x20;

Merrier you laugh, sadder they will weep

Louder you sing, more plaintive their lan1ent.

The governor and his cohorts recognizing 1he true identity of the poet. became frightened and fled from the scene. Remember that there are tears and heartaches of many behind one man's pleasure.

J. Be discreet

In every thing he does, a person must not be impulsive or reckless but be patient and thoughtful. " He who acts without thinking at least three times, w ill later regret his action," warns an old proverb.

Accordingly, on a matter of an important appointment or punish men 1, one must not decide hastily but must deliberate to reach a decision that is both fair and objective.

K. Know true happiness

Lao-Tzu pointed out that nature was based upon harmony in contrasts. For example, the universe was made up of two forces, Yin (female) and Yang (male) . Other contrasts were hard and soft, long and short. night and day. solid and empty, cold and warm, big and small, beautiful and ugly.

All things in this world are relative to one another. Misery can only come from having been happy once and sorrow from joy. The wealthy and the powerful are not necessari ly happy. For every rich person, there are countless poor and for each tyrant, a nation of oppressed. Mencius defined life·s three happinesses as follows:

1. Healthy parents and harmony w ithin the family.
2. To live with pride and honor through correct behavior.
3. To educate the young to become upright and useful members of society.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Educate the Young to produce heroic leaders</p></figcaption></figure>

L. Let your actions speak for yourself

Even the ablest orator is apt to err if given to verbiage. A closed mouth can save a fish from the hook as well as stay secrets from the enemy. To speak only what is meaningful 1s a sign of a cultivated person. People talk mostly to brag about themselves or to gain advantage over others.

A man of virtue expresses himself more through deeds than words. Thus. he influences others through living examples. In the old days, the truly effective way to teach was believed to be by the actions not by the words of the teacher.

M. Develop peace of mind

A clear pond becomes muddy if agitated and then returns to its original state when allowed to settle undisturbed.

It is said that calm will be able to conquer the heat. Undoubtedly you can endure the hottest summer heat if you sit calm and composed. Conversely, if you move too much in order to warm your freezing body you may get temporary rel ief. but it does not last too long.

We can attain peace of mind through meditation. by emptying our minds of all petty thoughts and returning to the natural state of man. Unlike in Buddhism or Zen. meditation in Taekwon-Do does not mean a total divorce from the world. Ii ke a dead body. but rather an active moment to reflect on our past mistakes in silence and in the privacy of our thoughts, and through penitence. to continue our self-improvement toward becoming beuer men or women.

This active thought process in silence is called "Jung-Jeong-Dong"

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Movement in tranquility</p></figcaption></figure>

N. Be of firm mind

A person of strong conviction is unsuspicious and unafraid. When proved wrong, he has the moral strength to admit his mistakes to even the most humble and has the courage to stand up to the mighty if he believes himself or herself to be right.

Strong conviction can be gained through rhe broad and deep " Ki"- spirit. Ki is a form of acttve energy which fills every physical cell and organ while " Chi"- will is the motivating force: lhe former moves and the latter leads. If " Ki" is nurtured with great care and allowed to grow based on humanity and justice, its soaring power and outreaching strength can fill the heaven and earth, e nab I, ng man to reach a new height of great achievements, so Mencius exhorted his disciples.

On a more practical level " Ki" helps us to keep our minds clear and alert when the affairs of life become strained and confused, or sees us through sleepless nights when our loved one is gravely ill.

0 . Be devoted

As meditation is to the religious, concentration and devotion is to the artist. and perseverance is to the labourer, so is moral culture to the practitioner of the martial arts.
