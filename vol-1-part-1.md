# VOL 1 - Part 1

## PREFACE (Morimal)

Words are inadequate to describe my feeling of jubilation on the day that Taekwon-Do was born, but at the same time, I was assailed by doubts and apprehensions. How many people would actually come to recognize and understand Taekwon-Do during my lifetime? It seems as though this happened only yesterday, and yet many years have passed, and today Taekwon-Do is not only an official activity of CISM (Council of International Sport Military), but it is under consideration for inclusion in the International Olympic Games. All of this has made me realize once again that the days travel with the speed of a flying arrow and the years flow like an irreversible river, but most significantly, it also proves that determination and faith can overcome any obstacle.

All things are governed by the law of Yin and Yang (dark and light). Happiness can often stem from catastrophic moments. My painful experiences of degradation and humiliation, when the Japanese colonization of Korea reduced me to a person without a country, inspired me to learn Taekwon-Do. I was further motivated by my desire to preserve and spread the spirit and wisdom of the Korean people to the world.

Needless to say, Taekwon-Do could not possibly have achieved the status it enjoys today without the tears of silent agony shed by the pioneers of Taekwon-Do who strove against all odds to introduce their art to the world.

Retrospectively, my troubles began soon after the formation of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Despite fierce opposition from my colleagues, I succeeded in introducing Taekwon-Do as a compulsory course in the army curriculum.



I was repaid with jealousy, slander and finally oppression. As a result, my army career came to an abrupt end. This was merely a prelude for what was to follow. The civilian gyms practicing Dang Soo-Do (Karate-Do) and Kong Soo-Do (Karate-Do) saw Taekwon-Do as a possible threat.

They reacted with bitter criticism. It is no wonder that these people, in whom a sense of nationalism is totally lacking, still hold a grudge against me. The incredible popularity of Taekwon-Do, in Korea as well as abroad, rapidly drove the practitioners of inferior martial art forms out of business.

My obsession with Taekwon-Do further led me to stand firm against the desire of corrupt government officials who wanted to use Taekwon-Do as a political instrument to strengthen their dictatorship. My outspoken criticism of the South Korean government - both then and now - has been frequently misinterpreted, making me appear as an enemy of my own people.

Taekwon-Do soon secured its international reputation for being both superior and different from the Karate that had previously been dominating the world of martial arts. This rivalism naturally added other names to my ever-increasing list of enemies.

In summation, my life has been a turbulent one, riddled with lonely fights and unfortunate adventure that few would envy ... a life of self-exile thousands of miles distant from my beloved country. Even so, it has truly been a worthwhile endeavor.

My dream has at last been realized... the ultimate fantasy of spreading and teaching Taekwon-Do with no regard to considerations of religion, ideology, national boundaries, or race. I can say without hesitation that I am the happiest man alive.



It is my earnest desire that Taekwon-Do should retain its original concept and technique. It is my sincere hope that Taekwon-Do's emphasis on promoting a healthier body and mind will provide a significant contribution to human progress for many generations to come.

It is one of nature's ironies that delicate plants such as orchids or tulips require extreme care while weeds flourish with no attention at all. Wild panic grass, easily mistaken for wheat or rice, can actually prevent the growth of the genuine article. I cannot help but despair over the tainted image of TaekwonDo recently created by practitioners of sham Taekwon-Do, who have nothing in common with the origin and art form except for a borrowed name.

I console myself with this thought: Like a counterfeit diamond that cannot cut glass, fraudulent Taekwon-Do is appearance without substance and like a summer shower that quickly dries from the earth or a hurricane that rapidly passes from the sky, phoney Taekwon-Do practitioners and imitators cannot endure. It exists solely on the strength of political influence and is totally devoid of fundamental philosophy or technique based on logic. As such, it is destined for an early exist. The issue lies in our ability to differentiate between the true and the false.

I wish to dedicate this Encyclopedia, ... the last product of my life-long research ... to my students in the hope that it will assist them in their pursuit of true Taekwon-Do.

I give special thanks to all instructors and black belt holders of many countries who have posed for photographs within this edition.

My sincere appreciation also goes to Mr. Han Chang Sam and my beloved student Sabree Salleh who willingly gave up much of their valuable time for photographing required for this edition.

## TAEKWON-DO AND IMITATORS

Today, the enormous popularity of Taekwon-Do has created imitators, and whilst at times imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, in the case of Taekwon-Do, this is definitely not true. To imitate without full knowledge of the original is dangerous. It is somewhat akin to allowing a child to play with a toy gun, then giving him a real gun and expecting the child to understand the difference without giving him the knowledge of the function and effect of a real gun.

In most instances of imitation, the imitator simply mimics the original without any change. Usually, this does not cause any harm provided the one who imitates does not change the original (in this case Taekwon-Do) by unproven additional techniques, interpretations. philosophy, terminology or systems and methods.

It is when unauthorized changes to the original art of Taekwon-Do take place that these imitators create a highly dangerous and eroding influence upon the concept of Taekwon-Do.

Dangerous, because it gives to the students of the imitators a sense of mastery of techniques which are completely unfounded in the knowledge of the true martial art of Taekwon-Do.

Dangerous, because a student may become a teacher and all unknowingly imparts his false techniques to others, thus compounding the error of false knowledge. This will lead to an erosion of confidence, by serious students, in Taekwon-Do as a proven martial art.

Confusion has recently arisen by the use of the terminology "TAEKWON-DO, THE KOREAN ART OF SELF-DEFENSE," I emphasize the word Korean.

Today, in the South Korea, it is becoming the practice to indiscriminately apply the word Taekwon-Do to a bastardized imitation of the real original Korean martial art.

General Choi Hong Hi has been creating, developing the art of Taekwon-Do since early 1946, in what is now known as the Republic of Korea. It is true that General Choi was born in Korea and at the time of developing and introducing Taekwon-Do he resided there. It is also true that the basis of Taekwon-Do goes back to the ancient past of Korea, but to call Taekwon-Do purely Korean is somewhat like one country claiming to have introduced fire.

The true Taekwon-Do of General Choi knows no boundaries of countries; it is a universal art of self-defense. It is also an art for which the author of this encyclopedia has devoted his life, not only to retain the purity of the original Taekwon-Do introduced by him in 1955, but to constantly search for ways of improving the original techniques. Only after exhaustive research and proof of improvement and effectiveness is a change to the original approved and incorporated within the overall art of Taekwon-Do.

These volumes are proof of General Choi's tenacity of dedication to keeping the original Taekwon-Do free from unproved imitations, and with the co-operation of all true Taekwon-Do students, no matter what grade, weed out those who seek to destroy his teachings.

## CHARTER OF TAEKWON-DO

_**(Taekwon-Do Hun Jang)**_

**PREAMBLE**

Since Taekwon-Do is an art of self-defence which aims at a noble moral rearmament, high degree of intellectual achievement, graceful techniques. formidable power and beauty of physical form, it can be considered as a part of one's daily life, just as are breathing and thinking.

As the founder of Taekwon-Do. I would like to define its philosophy, principles, and purposes so that these might be applied to bring about the flowering of morality, beauty, and power in harmony with the immortal spirit.

**PART 1.**

Through scientific practice of Taekwon-Do one can significantly improve his health and nourish his intellect. One can be in a position to aid others in the cause of justice, thereby promoting social ethics and morals, thus helping to ' bring about a happier and more peaceful society.

**PART 2.**

In order to come to terms with life, in spite of its detestable aspects, and with the idea of death. one ought to continue studying the art of Taekwon-Do to learn techniques of power and grace, and to enlarge his spiritual realm. Thus the motivation to study shall be an inheritance of limitless value to succeeding generations.

**PART 3.**

Human beings come into the world with simple needs and desires. They need not become avaricious but ought to remain always humble and merciful, never compromise their principles, nor be swayed by selfish motives, to insure freedom and independence of Taekwon-Do so that it will be passed on in its pure form.

**PART 4.**

Since all students of the art are subject to the same rules of conduct and judged according to the same criteria regardless of their stations in life, their origins, and their religious convictions, they demonstrate to the world the essential equality and brotherhood of man.

**PART 5.**

Modern society is characterised by selfish preoccupation with material excess and unnecessary dependence upon machines. Moral society is characterised by self discipline, sacrifice, and devotion. Dedication to the art can promote change toward a moral society.

**PART 6.**

Those who devote themselves to their fellows and live according to the dictates of their consciences are always helpful toward their juniors and show respect toward their instructors and their seniors.

**CONCLUSION**

A beginning constitutes a significant part of the whole endeavor. Therefore, students of Taekwon-Do should not fail to take action whenever to do so might benefit the society. If he behaves thus, he himself will benefit most.



## THE TENETS OF TAEKWON-DO

_**(Taekwon-Do Jungshin)**_

TAEKWON-DO AIMS TO ACHIEVE

**Courtesy** (Ye Ui)

**Integrity** (Yon Chi)

**Perseverance** (In Nae)

**Self-Control** (Guk Gi)

**Indomitable Spirit** (Baekjul Boo/goof)

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)



## EXPLANATION OF TENETS

Needless 10 say, the success or failure of Taekwon-Do training depends largely on how one observes and implements the tenets of Taekwon-Do, which should serve as a guide for all serious students of the art. COURTESY (Ye Ui) Taekwon-Do students should attempt to practise the following elements of courtesy to build up their noble character and to conduct the training in an orderly manner as well.

1. To promote the spirit of mutual concessions
2. To be ashamed of one's vices, contemplating those of others
3. To be polite to one another
4. To encourage the sense of justice and humanity
5. To distinguish instructor from student. senior from junior, and elder from younger
6. To behave oneself according to etiquette
7. To respect others' possesions
8. To handle matters with fairness and sincerity
9. To refrain from giving or accepting any gift when in doubt

**INTEGRITY** (Yom Chi)

In Taekwon-Do, the word integrity assumes a looser definition than the one usually presented in Webster's dictionary. One must be able to define right and wrong and have the conscience, if wrong, to feel guilt. Listed are some examples, where integrity is lacking:

1. The instructor who misrepresents himself and his art by presenting improper techniques to his students because of a lack of knowledge or apathy.
2. The student who misrepresents himself by "fixing" breaking materials before demonstrations.
3. The instructor who camouflages bad techniques with luxurious training halls and false flattery to his students.
4. The student who requests rank from an instructor, or attempts to purchase it.
5. The student who gains rank for ego purposes or the feeling of power.
6. The instructor who teaches and promotes his art for materialistic gains.
7. The student whose actions do not live up to his words.
8. The student who feels ashamed to seek opinions from his juniors.

**PERSEVERANCE** (In Nae)

There is an old Oriental saying, "Patience leads to virtue or merit", "One can make a peaceful home by being patient for 100 times." Certainly, happiness and prosperity are most likely brought to the patient person. To achieve something, whether it is a higher degree or the perfection of a technique, one must set his goal. then constantly persevere. Robert Bruce learned his lesson of perseverance from the persistent efforts of a lowly spider. It was this perseverance and tenacity that finally enabled him to free Scotland in the fourteenth century. One of the most important secrets in becoming a leader of Taekwon-Do is to overcome every difficulty by perseverance.

Confucius said; "one who is impatient in trivial matters can seldom achieve success in matters of great importance."

**SELF-CONTROL** (Guk Gi)

This tenet is extremely important inside and outside the do jang, whether conducting oneself in free sparring or in one's personal affairs. A loss of self-control in free sparring can prove disastrous to both student and opponent. An inability to live and work within one's capability or sphere is also a lack of self-control.

According to Lao-Tzu "the term of stronger is the person who wins over oneself rather than someone else."

**INDOMITABLE SPIRIT** (Baekjul Boolgool)

"Here lie 300, who did their duty," a simple epitaph for one of the greatest acts of courage known to mankind.

Although facing the superior forces of Xerxes. Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermopylae showed the world the meaning of indomitable spirit. It is shown when a courageous person and his principles are pitted against overwhelming odds.

A serious student of Taekwon-Do will at all times be modest and honest. If confronted with injustice, he will deal with the belligerent without any fear or hesitation at all, with indomitable spirit, regardless of whosoever and however many the number may be.

Confucius declared; "it is an act of cowardice to fail to speak out against injustice." As history has proven, those who have pursued their dreams earnestly and strenuously with indomitable spirit have never failed to achieve their goals.

## DEFINITION OF TAEKWON-DO

**TAEKWON-DO**............ A way of life. What exactly is the meaning of Taekwon-Do?

To put it simply Taekwon-Do is a version of unarmed combat designed for the purpose of self-defence. It is more than just that, however.

It is the scientific use of the body in the method of self-defence; a body that has gained the ultimate use of its facilities through intensive physical and mental training. It is a martial art that has no equal in either power or technique. Though it is a martial art, its discipline, technique and mental training are the mortar for building a strong sense of justice, fortitude, humility and resolve. It is this mental conditioning that separates the true practitioner from the sensationalist, content with mastering only the fighting aspects of the art.

This is one of the reasons that Taekwon-Do is called an art of self-defence. It also implies a way of thinking and life, particularly in instilling a concept and spirit of strict self-imposed discipline and an ideal of noble moral rearmament.

The nearest description of it is almost a cult.

Translated literally, "Tae" stands for Jumping or flying, to kick or smash with the foot. " Kwon" denotes the fist- chiefly to punch or destroy with the hand or fist. "Do" means an art or way- the right way built and paved by the saints and sages in the past. Thus taken collectively " Taekwon-Do" indicates the mental training and the techniques of unarmed combat for self-defence as well as health, involving the skilled application of punches, kicks, blocks and dodges with bare hands and feet to the rapid destruction of the moving opponent or opponents.

Taekwon-Do definitely enables the weak to possess a fine weapon together with a confidence to defend him or herself and defeat the opponent as well.

Of course, wrongly applied, Taekwon-Do can be a lethal weapon. Therefore mental training must always be stressed to prevent the student from misusing it.

As for woman folk, they will undoubtedly find Taekwon-Do an invaluable asset in tackling and driving away "wolves", so to speak. When one is informed of the many instances where frail women effectively protected themselves, they may sound unbelievable. But really, they have been able to do so because they are well-versed in the art of self-defence.

The feats of Taekwon-Do are great in number. To mention a few is probably pertinent: For instance. flying over a mounted motorcycle or eleven persons in line to attack a target with the foot; breaking an inch-thick pine board placed at a height of ten or eleven feet with the foot; breaking two pieces of red brick with an open hand or knife -hand; smashing seven or eight pieces of two-inch thick pine board at a single blow with the fist; attacking two targets with the same foot in succession while flying and so on. To the layman in the street, such feats may sound impossible. but to the serious students of Taekwon -Do and the exponents of this art, it is quite ordinary. Of course, by mastering this art, it does not mean that you will be asked to do acts of impossibility.

Particularly if someone should challenge you to kill a wild bull with your bare hands. Therefore it is clear that equivalent demonstrations of such effective use or pure somatic force is not to be seen in other forms of physical combat technique.

Incessant training is essential to keep oneself in top form and physical condition. In training, all the muscles of the human body will be used.

From the use of one's muscles, it will be possible to harness all available power generated by every muscular contraction. It will then be necessary to deliver such power to the human target especially to where the most vulnerable points or vital spots of one's opponent are located, in particular when the opponent is in motion.

At this point. it is necessary to remind the students of Taekwon-Do that this art of self-defence is specially designed for swift retaliation against the moving aggressor

Most of the devastating manoeuvres in Taekwon-Do are based specially on the initial impact o f a blow plus the consequential additional force provided by the rebound of the opponents moving part of the body.

Similarly by using the attacker's force of momentum, the slightest push is all that is needed to upset his or her equilibrium and to topple him or her.

In the case of the students of Taekwon-Do who have been in constant practice or the experts themselves, they spend no time thinking, as such an action comes automatically to them. Their actions. in short. have become conditioned reflexes

Therefore. throughout this Encyclopedia, the readers will notice that repeated emphasis is placed on regular training, in order to master the techniques of attack and defence.

Hours spent on training will not be wasted; for surely you will reap a rich reward in the form of speedy reactions and deadly blows to rain down upon your enemy or in any case to save life if and when a need arises.

Even if Taekwon-Do is practiced for the sake of exercise alone. the enjoyment derived will justify the time invested and spent. As an exercise. it is equally suitable for the old and young. male and female.

## THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARTIAL ARTS

Farming, fishing, hunting, medical science, trading and written language are said to have been taught during the reigns of the three mythical emperors Bok Hi, Sin Nong and Hwang Je in China about 3,500 B.C

On the other hand, the mural paintings in tombs along the Nile and the hieroglyphic inscriptions engraved in the pyramids proved that the Egyptians had a form of open hand fighting similar to boxing as early as 3,000 B.C.

We also have reports of open hand fighting techniques practiced by the warriors of Mesopotamia and Sumer (3,000 B.C.- 2.300 B.C.). Then, we can easily imagine that primitive human beings had to depend on their hands and feet to overcome enemies, animals, and the obstacles to survival found in nature.

As human knowledge and wisdom progressed, these crude fighting methods were gradually and continuously improved. Eventually, they were systematized as martial arts.

By the time of the Greek city-states (700 B.C.), boxing, wrestling and other related forms of combat were regular events in the Olympiads. The works of Homer (800-900 B.C.) contain descriptions of unarmed combat, and the Greek philosopher Plato (347-427 B.C.) mentions skiamachia (fighting without an opponent) - a kind of shadow-boxing, which was eventually combined with wrestling and boxing to form pancratium. This was a fighting system in which the whole body was used as a weapon.

The Greek practitioners of pancratium were later transformed into Roman gladiators. The gladiatorial games were ferocious sports performed for the entertainment of spectators during the golden age of the Roman Empire. These games were introduced into Germany, Normandy and England after the fall of Rome and subsequently became the basis of modern boxing and wrestling.

It is recorded that some types of open hand fighting were widely practiced in China at an early date. The art of Palgwae flourished during the era of Ju Gong (approximately 200 B.C.) and came to be perfected during the Song Dynasty a thousand years later.

Throughout the world numerous styles of hand and foot fighting have been developed, each of which reflects the needs of the time and the varying historical and cultural background of the country where it originated.

In China, open hand fighting is called Kung-Fu or Daeji-Chon; in India Selamban; in France Savate; in Japan, Judo, Karate or Aikido or Jujitsu; in Russia Samba; in Malaysia Bosilat; in Thailand KickBoxing; and in Korea it is known as Taek-Kyon, Soo-Bak-Gi, and Taekwon-do.

Some of these forms of sell-defence are no doubt as old as mankind itself. It would be virtually impossible to trace hand and foot fighting back to any single beginning.

There are certainly many legends regarding the origins of such weaponless fighting and all too often have some let legend be accepted as truth. There are some authorities who believe that the main impetus of bare hand fighting emerged in China during the sixth century by a renowned Buddhist monk named Bodhidharma (Tamo in Chinese; Oaruma in Japanese) the third son of the Indian King Brahman who was known as the 28th Indian patriarch of Buddhist Zen.

The essence of Zen or doctrine or Tranquility is to shun material desire, power, greed, vanity and so on through an inward enlightenment.

Oaruma (448-529 A.0 .)supposedly journeyed from a southern Indian monastery to China via the Himalayas to instruct the Liang Dynasty monarch in the tenets of Buddhism. It is claimed that upon his arrival in China, he went to a monastery called Shaoling Temple located in Shao Shik mountain in 520 A.D.

There he undertook the task of teaching Buddhism to the Chinese monks. They reportedly became physically exhausted from the severe discipline and intense pace that was set by Daruma. To train themselves to accept the harshness of the discipline. Daruma introduced them to a method of mental and physical conditioning outlined in the books I-Jin Kyong (muscle development) and Si Shim Kyong (mind cleaning). These were intended to free them from all conscious control and thus permit them to attain enlightenment. At the same time, supplementing their daily exercise was Shih Pa Lo-han (18 movements of Lo-han hands) which imitated the posture of 18 different temple idols.&#x20;

As a result, they supposedly became the most formidable fighters in China.

It is said this method was eventually combined with Shih Pa Lo-han to form the famous Shaoling boxing or Ch'yan Fa (method of Shaoling Fist).

There is little historical data to substantiate this story. Careful scrutiny of the evidence reveals that Daruma arrived in China during the Liang Dynasty of the sixth century. He initially attempted to teach Buddhism to King Moo Je at Kwang Joo but was refused admission to the palace grounds. The missionary then went to small country in the north of China called Ui where he was invited to teach King Myong Je. For reasons that are unknown, Daruma refused the offer and retired to the Shaoling Temple where he remained in meditation and devotion until his death nine years later.

During the period between 1st century B.C. and 7th Century A.O .. the Korean peninsula was divided into three Kingdoms; Silla, Koguryo and Baek Je. Silla, the smallest of these kingdoms was constantly under invasion and harassmen1 by its two more powerful northern and western neighbours. During the reign of Chin Heung, Twenty-fourth King of Silla, the young aristocrats and warrior class formed an elite officers corps called Hwa Rangdo.

This warrior corps - in addition to the ordinary training in spear, bow, sword and hook - also trained themselves by practicing mental and physical discipline, and various forms of hand and foot fighting. To harden their bodies, they climbed rugged mountains, swam the turbulent rivers in the coldest months, and drove themselves unmercifully to prepare for the task of defending their homeland.

To guide themselves and give purpose to their knighthood, they incorporated a five-point code of conduct set forth by their country's greatest Buddhist monk and scholar Won Kang.

1. Be loyal to your king.
2. Be obedient to your parents.
3. Be honourable to your friends.
4. Never retreat in battle.
5. Make a just kill.

The Hwa Rangdo became known in the peninsula for their courage and skill in battle, gaining respect from even their bitterest foes.

The strength they derived from their respect to their code enabled them to attain feats of valour that became legendary. Many of these brave young warriors died on fields of battle in the threshold of their youth - as young as fourteen or fifteen years of age.

The statue of Kumkang-Yuksa, a famous warrior in Sukulam, a stone cave built in the age of the Silla Dynasty.

Notice the similarities in form between the Kumkang-Yuksa and present day Taekwon-Do.

The appearance of clenched fist, a strong knife-hand, and muscled legs which may have been result of heavy training.

There is much historical evidence to document the existence of a form of hand and foot fighting during this period in both Silla and Koguryo. Some of the postures resemble Taek Kyon or Japanese Jujitsu techniques.

It appears that the warriors of Hwa Rangdo added a new dimension to this primitive method of foot fighting by gearing it to combat and infusing the principles of the Hwa Rangdo. The new mental concept as well as the physical, elevating toot fighting to an art.

During the period of Hwa Rangdo, the original primitive method of hand fighting called Soo Bak-Gi was popular among the common people in the Koguryo Dynasty. The people had a high regard for Soo Bak-Gi. During the Dan-0 festivals (on the 5th of May of the lunar calendar) and mid-Autumn festivals (August 15th of the lunar calendar) competitions of Soo Bak-Gi were held along with games of Korean wrestling, tug of war, hopping contests and Jeki-Chagi.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The mural painting at the Kak-je Tomb, painted in the age of San-Sang, the tenth king of Koguryo, shows sparring of Soo Bak-Gi. Once again, notice the similarities of these postures and Taekwon-Do flying combatants.</p></figcaption></figure>

The famous Korean historian, Dr. Danjae Shin Chae Ho, in his writings of ancient Chosun, describes the contests of skill and courage under grueling conditions; "dancing with swords and certain water sports were held on the frozen river to test a contestant's courage and perseverance. Archery and Taek Kyon contests were held to test skill and power.

The winner of the hunt was given the title of Son-Bi. All the above were judged to be necessary prerequisites of the warriors, and the winners were held in esteem by all". Dr.Danjae states further, that the art of Soo Bak-Gi was eventually introduced to China as Kwon Bup and as a form of Jujitsu to Japan.

While pursuing historical documents relating to the martial arts in Korea, it was interesting to discover that the third king of the Yi Dynasty (1401 -1408) actively recruited experts in Taek Kyon, Sirum (Korean Wrestling), stone throwing, archery, and Soo Bak-Gi to help in organising a strong army.

Much historical documentation seems to indicate that some of these forms of open hand fighting may have been eventually exported to Japan and formed the basis for Japanese Jujitsu and Karate.

The Korean Hwa Rangdo may have been the forerunners of the famed Japanese samurai. In his book "This is Karate," Matutatsu Oyama, a well-known authority of Karate in Japan, mentions that the etymology of Kara may have been derived from the country of Kaya at the southern tip of the Korean peninsula.



_The mural painting at Kangso Tomb, 7th century, shows the advanced skill in art and the mysterious usage of everlasting colors, the technique of which remains unexplained._
